# Map View

The native map screen showing location-based content, user position, and contextual overlays

## Checklist

- **Pin and marker designs**: Custom markers clearly distinguishable from each other and from the base map, sized for reliable tap accuracy on mobile
  Ensure the marker design for current location is the most prominent, as all map view interactions are centred around it
- **Marker clustering (if applicable)**: How markers are shown when a group of them are so close together they cannot be shown individually, and must be grouped
- **Native map components**: Leverage either MapKit for iOS or Google Maps for Android to utilise existing foundations and layout that is time consuming to create from scratch
- **Location permission**: The point in the flow at which location permission is requested, with context explaining the level of access needed and why
  Consider the UI if permissions are denied, where you can provide instructions on how to change the permission in settings
- **Current location re-centre**: A clearly visible button to re-centre the map to the user's current position without zooming or scrolling to it
- **Selected item bottom sheet**: Tapping a marker expanding a bottom sheet with details about that location — not a full-screen navigation away from the map.
- **Search or filter actions**: Search or filter controls accessible as a persistent overlay on the map or as a separate screen
  Selecting filters can be on a separate screen, but when on map the applied filters should be visible for context
- **Offline handling**: When offline, cached map tiles displayed where available, with a clear indicator that the map may not be current
