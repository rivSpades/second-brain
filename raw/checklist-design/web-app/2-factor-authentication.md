# 2FA Web App

A screen that guides users through setting up or completing two-factor authentication to add a second layer of security to their account

## Checklist

- **Method selection**: Authenticator app, SMS, or email code
  Offer at least 2 methods as some users potentially don't have access to one or the other
- **Setup instructions**: Clear step-by-step guidance for completing setup, particularly for authenticator flows that require scanning a QR code
- **QR code or setup key**: A scannable QR code or copyable key for linking an authenticator app to the account
  Ensure QR code size large enough to be easy to scan
- **Verification step**: A code entry step confirming the setup was successful before 2FA is enabled on the account
  Enabling 2FA without this step risks a silent setup failure that locks the user out — a serious support burden
- **Recovery codes**: A set of one-time backup codes the user can use if they lose access to their 2FA method
  Make download or copying the code a required step before completing setup for the sake of the user
- **Setup confirmation**: A clear success state confirming that 2FA is now active on the account
- **Disable or reset option**: A way for users to turn off or reconfigure 2FA, accessible from account security settings
  Re-authentication should be required before disabling 2FA
