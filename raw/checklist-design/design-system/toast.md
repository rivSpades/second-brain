# Toast Design System

A toast is a brief, non-disruptive message that appears temporarily at the edge of the screen to provide feedback about an action or system status.

## Checklist

- **Copy**: The text in the toast
  Copy should be clear and concise, focusing on a status or action
- **Placement**: Toast should appear on the corners of the viewport, not as the focus
- **Usage**: Toasts are triggered to appear after an action or event
- **Variants**: Dictated by colour usually, variants affects the emotion of a message
  Example: A green toast informing success, red toast informing error. If informing a status, don't rely on just color and leverage icons or the copy.
- **Length of appearance**: Toasts should be visible long enough to read but short enough to not obstruct other information for too long
  Read the text out loud slowly to gauge how much time is needed
- **Dismissable**: Depending on the amount of content, a toast can be closed by a user (it should fade away shortly after appearing if it cannot be manually dismissed)

## Documentation

### Action
A toast can contain an action: to dismiss, or a specific action related to the context of the toast (view, undo, remove). Not every toast requires an action, so long as it disappears after a set time.

### Placement
Toasts typically appear on the edges of an interface, to be intrusive but not interrupting. The visual represents common spots it can be placed on desktop.

### Automatic dismissal
Toasts should stay visible enough to be acknowledged, but eventually dismiss to not intrude the interface for too long
